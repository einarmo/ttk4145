Both C and python behave in the very thready way of randomly running scheduling the threads according to the OS, so we end up with numbers between -1000000 and 1000000.
GO uses coroutines, and schedules them in such a way that we always end up with 0. The essential difference is that GO does not rely on the complex scheduling done by the OS, but does things itself. In the case of Python and C we usually end up relatively close to 0, with any difference accounted for by random processes running in the background. In GO, the threads are controlled by go itself, so we don't get that kind of OS-specific behaviour.
